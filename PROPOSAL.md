# Detecting Banking Sector Stress from Equity-Market Signals 

This project develops a market-based Bank Equity Stress Index using daily stock price data from majour U.S. banks. The aim is to analyse on how stress within the banking sector appears in financial markets without making assumptions about internal mechanisms such as deposit withdrawals or liquidity pressures, which cannot be observed in publicly available datasets. Instead, the project focuses solely on how uncertainty and change in confidence are reflected in measurable market signals. 

Using historical price data collected through the yfinance API, the project computes a set of standard indicators widely used in empirical finance. These include daily log returns, rolling volatility, and rolling pairwise correlations across banks. Volatility provides a sense of how uncertain individual institutions appear to investors, while correlations capture how closely bank's stock movements align during the periods when sentiment becomes more fragile. These indicators are combined into a simple and transparent stress index that summarizes market-perceived tension in the sector. 

To identify periods of elevated stress, days are labelled using a high-quantile thresholds of the index, such as tagging the top 5% of values as "stress days". These automatically generated stress labels are then compared are then compared with well-known historical market disruptions, such as the 2008 financial crisis, the March 2020 Covid-19 shock, and the March 2023 U.S. banking turmoil, to check whether the stress index aligns with those periods widely recognized as stressful. 

The project also explores whether these market-based indicators can help detect elevated stress conditions. A logistic regression model is trained using lagged versions of the index and related features to evaluate whether simple, interpretable signals contain predictive value. The goal is not to create a sophisticated forecasting model but to understand whether a basic market indicators can help differentiate higher-stress days from calmer days using an out-of-sample evaluation. 

A possible challenge of the project could be is making sure that the index and the model are evaluated properly over time, so that the results are meaningful and not influenced by future information. And since the project solely relies on market signals collected from yfinance another challenge could be if those captured signals truly reflect the real conditions. 

The project will be considered successfully, if it produces a clear, reproducible pipeline. Meaning the stress index aligns plausibly more or less with known historical stress periods and if the simple ML model shows at least some ability to distinguish elevated stress conditions out-of-sample. Clear and interpretable visualizations of stress over time will also be key indicators of success.
