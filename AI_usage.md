# AI usage disclosure : 

For the project I have used the AI tools ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot:

- I used Copilot and ChatGPT for helping me with the coding of the project and to receive a better understanding on how VS Code Nuvolos is linked with GitHub. Since I have never used GitHub before, I needed certain guidance on how GitHub works and the specific commands to commit everything on to my GitHub repository. 

- ChatGPT was used to help with debugging. I also used ChatGPT when converting my markdown file of the paper to a pdf file version. While converting I encountered some issues, which is why the markdown file of the paper is called 'project_report_clean.md' instead of 'project_report.md'. 

- ChatGPT and Copilot helped me with having a better idea on how to build a good interactive GitHub repository. 

- ChatGPT also helped me with defining my crisis windows since as mentionned before sources defined the timelines of those crisis differently. 

- ChatGPT gave me an overview on how to build the paper and making sure that I have a correct interpretation of all my results. It also helped me with writing the mathematical formulas correctly and writing the tables.
