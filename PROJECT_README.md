# Bank Stress Detection Project

This project implements a full data science pipeline to detect bank stress days using a financial market–based stress index.

It includes data processing, feature engineering, logistic-regression modeling, evaluation, and a reproducible pipeline via `main.py`.

---

## Structure

- `src/bank_stress/` → core source code (data utilities, features, stress index, labels, models, evaluation)  
- `tests/` → unit tests verifying correctness of utility and evaluation functions  
- `notebooks/` → exploratory analysis, feature creation, and label generation  
- `results/` → output generated by the pipeline (figures, metrics, trained model)  
- `environment.yml` → reproducible environment for running the project  
- `main.py` → the complete end-to-end pipeline script

---

## How to Reproduce the Pipeline

1. Create the conda environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

2. Activate the environment

```bash
conda activate bank-stress-project
```

3. Run the full pipeline

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
- Build the machine-learning dataset
- Train the baseline logistic regression
- Evaluate the model
- Generate ROC and Precision–Recall curves
- Save all results in the `results/` directory

---

## Running Tests

To ensure correctness:

```bash
pytest -q
```

All tests should pass inside the environment created from `environment.yml`.

---

## Project Goal

The final question addressed is:

“Can a simple logistic-regression model based on a stress index detect bank stress days in out-of-sample data?”

The answer appears in the Conclusion section printed by `main.py`, supported by generated metrics and evaluation plots.

---

## Notes

- The project is fully reproducible via the `environment.yml` file.  
- The `results/` folder contains both notebook-generated exploratory figures and pipeline-generated outputs.  
- Only the `main.py`-generated results are ignored via `.gitignore`; notebook figures are intentionally kept for documentation.
